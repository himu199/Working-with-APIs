# Working-with-APIs
This repository stores my work with APIs . People say  data is the new oil. As data is becoming more and more  valuble, companies are trying to monetize their asset by securing their data behind api keys, hence "Working with APIs". 

The first project is a free public api to get data on the characters of the popular animated science fiction sitcom 'Rick and Morty'. The data extracted from the json response is given here..[Rick&Morty.csv](https://github.com/himu199/Working-with-APIs/files/7028065/Rick.Morty.csv)

Getting_TV_series_data_with_API project overview:
  * Request Json data
  * Parse through json data 
  * Extract only required data
  * Create pandas dataframe
  * Save dataframe as 'csv' file

In the second project I have worked with a more popular api, the Spotify api. Here I had to perform Oauth2 authorization and get access token from the spotify server. I performed a search operation and then I extracted data to get all the popular tracks by the famous artist Drake. The csv file is attached here..[Drake popular tracks.csv](https://github.com/himu199/Working-with-APIs/files/7028068/Drake.popular.tracks.csv)

Spotify_API project overview:
  * Perform Oauth2 authorization and connect with app
  * Get temporary access token
  * Search artist, albums, tracks
  * Use artist id to request json data on top tracks
  * Extract required data
  * Create pandas dataframe
  * Save dataframe as '.csv' file
